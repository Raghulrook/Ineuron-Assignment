Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Ans;

In Python basically the code written human language and then it is converted into the machine language by using interpretor, as the process is being easy for us to understand that how python is a general purpose and high level language 

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Ans;

In python there no need to enter the data variable typr i.e; int x=2; rather we can use x=2 in dynamically typed language rather statically typed language and aslo Dynamically typed language is Run Time process and Statically typed Language is Compile Time

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Ans;

Python is a high level, Interpreted, and Dynamically Typed Language which it has pros and cons like firstly Pros are compilation speed is faster, Portability is Good, but cons are the Execution Time taken by Python is slower then the other Complier language like java

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Ans;

Python programming language is used for domains such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning, it's also a fundamental tool for any data Analysis and Visulation

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

Ans;

Variables are like naming the object that can be stored in anywere in the memory location when there is a need we can use te name to call the object
i.e; (in python)-
X=2, print(X), print(type(X))

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

Ans;

we can the user input as declaring common human language 
i.e; (in python)-M=int(input("Random value")), print("the value of M is",M), print("data type of M is ",type(M))

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Ans;

the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function is str - String data type in python 


Q8. What is type casting?

Ans;

Type casting is a process that change the nature of Intiger to Float and Float to Intiger i.e; in python - M=float(input("Random no. decimal value ",)), 
print("the value of M is",M), 
print("data type of M is ",type(M)), 
print("data type of M had changed to Intiger is ",int(M))

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Ans;

yes we can use one input function or more than one input from users,
i.e;A,B,C,D,E,F,G=input("Enter the Seven Value",).split()
print("First number is {}, second number is {}, third number is {}, fourth is {}, Five number is {}, Six number is {}, Seven number is {}".format(A, B, C, D, E, F, G)) 

Q10. What are keywords?

Ans;

Python has a set of keywords that are reserved words that cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers ,i.e; Append,and,not,or,str,class ,type.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

Ans;

We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name, or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.
All the keywords except True, False and None are in lowercase i.e; true,false,none and they must be written as they are. The list of all the keywords is given below.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Ans;

The identification of a block of code in Python is done using Indentation. In many different programming languages like C, C++, Java, etc. use flower brackets or braces {} to define or to identify a block of code in the program, whereas in Python, it is done using the spaces or tabs, which is known as indentation.
i.e;
n = 10
if n>5:
print ("n is greater than 5")
else:
print ("n is not greater than 5")

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

Q14. What are operators in Python?

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.

iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

Q18. What are boolean operator?

Q19. What will the output of the following?

1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
