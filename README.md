Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Ans;

In Python basically the code written human language and then it is converted into the machine language by using interpretor, as the process is being easy for us to understand that how python is a general purpose and high level language 

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Ans;

In python there no need to enter the data variable typr i.e; int x=2; rather we can use x=2 in dynamically typed language rather statically typed language and aslo Dynamically typed language is Run Time process and Statically typed Language is Compile Time

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Ans;

Python is a high level, Interpreted, and Dynamically Typed Language which it has pros and cons like firstly Pros are compilation speed is faster, Portability is Good, but cons are the Execution Time taken by Python is slower then the other Complier language like java

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Ans;

Python programming language is used for domains such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning, it's also a fundamental tool for any data Analysis and Visulation

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

Ans;

Variables are like naming the object that can be stored in anywere in the memory location when there is a need we can use te name to call the object
i.e; (in python)-
X=2, print(X), print(type(X))

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

Ans;

we can the user input as declaring common human language 
i.e; (in python)-M=int(input("Random value")), print("the value of M is",M), print("data type of M is ",type(M))

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Ans;

the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function is str - String data type in python 


Q8. What is type casting?

Ans;

Type casting is a process that change the nature of Intiger to Float and Float to Intiger i.e; in python - M=float(input("Random no. decimal value ",)), 
print("the value of M is",M), 
print("data type of M is ",type(M)), 
print("data type of M had changed to Intiger is ",int(M))

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Q10. What are keywords?
